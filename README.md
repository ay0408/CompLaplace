# CompLaplace

We have developed privacy-preserving methods that combine the compressive mechanism and the Laplace mechanism.

This contains the Python codes for our experiments in which we evaluated our mechanisms in terms of accuracy, rank error, and run time.

For details of our mechanisms, please see our paper entitled "Privacy-Preserving Statistical Analysis of Genomic Data using Compressive Mechanism".
